## Versions
- v0.0 - 01/15/2022 - Initial commit
- v0.1 - 01/17/2022 - Improved overfitting just a little bit by randomizing 
  the positions of the players and the ball so they kind of 
  play a real game of crashing into each other now
## Credits
- I took a bunch of textures from Google so I can't remember where exactly I got
  each of them, but I know that I got the flag images from Britannica
